The United Nations' Global Goals, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aim to promote global development and well-being by addressing a range of social, economic, and environmental issues. Goal 3, "Good Health and Well-being," specifically focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Providence Healthtech's EMR software can play a significant role in achieving this goal by providing healthcare systems with real-time access to patient information, improving patient outcomes, and supporting population health management.

One of the primary benefits of the Providence platform is the digitization and centralization of patient information allowing healthcare providers to easily access and share patient information, including medical history, allergies, current medications, and immunization status. This greatly improves patient outcomes by ensuring healthcare providers have all the necessary information at their disposal, helping prevent medical errors such as prescribing contraindicated drugs or duplicating tests. Additionally, this improves continuity of care as healthcare providers easily share patient information with other providers, such as specialists or hospitals.

Providence's EMR software supports population health management by providing healthcare providers with real-time data on patient health and community trends. This data allows providers to identify and address health disparities and allows for targeted interventions to improve public health, improve health outcomes in marginalized communities, and reduce health inequalities.

Providence also improves patient engagement by giving patients access to their own health information and allowing them to communicate with their healthcare providers through secure messaging and telemedicine. This promotes self-management of chronic conditions and improve patient satisfaction.

Providence Healthtech is working to achieving the United Nations' Global Goals, specifically Goal 3, "Good Health and Well-being," by providing healthcare providers with real-time access to patient information, improving patient outcomes, supporting population health management, and improving patient engagement. As healthcare providers continue to adopt EMRs software, it will be essential to ensure that these systems are secure, interoperable, and accessible to all.
